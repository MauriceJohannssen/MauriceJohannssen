### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me
I'm Maurice, a 22-year old student from Nordhorn - Germany, which is located directly at the Dutch-German border.</br> I was interested in technology and games early on, reaching back to playing Donkey Kong on my grandpa's Game Boy. I was always curious about how things work the way they do, whether it's physics, music, or games. During high school, I discovered my passion for programming and knew, that I want to build upon this interesting and exciting field, which is why I decided to study "Creative Media and Game Technologies" at Saxion UAS in Enschede - Netherlands. I always strive to create and learn about new, innovative, and unconventional technologies to push forward and create awesome software.
